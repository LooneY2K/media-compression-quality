# New logic:

Detailed Argument Explanation

-y

Purpose: Overwrite output file without asking for confirmation
Usage: Global option

-i input_path

Purpose: Specifies the input file
Usage: Input file option

-preset veryslow

Purpose: Sets the encoding preset
Usage: Output file option
Description: Determines encoding speed and compression efficiency. 'veryslow' provides the best compression but takes the longest to encode.
Note: This conflicts with a later -preset slow argument. The last one in the command will take effect.

-crf 18

Purpose: Sets the Constant Rate Factor for quality-based variable bitrate
Usage: Output file option
Description: Range is 0-51, where 0 is lossless, 23 is default, and 51 is worst quality. 18 provides very high quality.
Note: This conflicts with a later -crf 23 argument. The last one in the command will take effect.

-maxrate 6000k

Purpose: Sets the maximum bitrate
Usage: Output file option
Description: Limits the maximum bitrate to 6000 kilobits per second.

-bufsize 9000k

Purpose: Sets the buffer size for rate control
Usage: Output file option
Description: Specifies the decoder buffer size, which affects how strictly the encoder adheres to the maximum bitrate.

-vf "unsharp=5:5:1.0,scale='min(1440,iw)':'-2'"

Purpose: Applies video filters
Usage: Output file option
Description:

unsharp=5:5:1.0: Applies an unsharp mask (slight sharpening effect)
scale='min(1440,iw)':'-2': Scales the video width to 1440 pixels if it's larger, maintaining aspect ratio. The -2 ensures the height is even (required for some codecs).

-c:v libx264

Purpose: Specifies the video codec
Usage: Output file option
Description: Uses the libx264 codec for H.264 video encoding

-preset slow

Purpose: Sets the encoding preset
Usage: Output file option
Description: 'slow' provides better compression than faster presets, at the cost of increased encoding time.
Note: This conflicts with the earlier -preset veryslow argument. This 'slow' setting will take precedence.

-crf 23

Purpose: Sets the Constant Rate Factor
Usage: Output file option
Description: 23 is the default value, providing a good balance between quality and file size.
Note: This conflicts with the earlier -crf 18 argument. This value (23) will take precedence.

-pix_fmt yuv420p10le

Purpose: Sets the pixel format
Usage: Output file option
Description: Specifies 10-bit YUV 4:2:0 pixel format, which provides better color depth than 8-bit.

-c:a aac

Purpose: Specifies the audio codec
Usage: Output file option
Description: Uses the AAC codec for audio encoding

-b:a 192k

Purpose: Sets the audio bitrate
Usage: Output file option
Description: Sets the audio bitrate to 192 kilobits per second

-movflags +faststart

Purpose: Optimizes the output file for web streaming
Usage: Output file option
Description: Moves the 'moov' atom to the beginning of the file, allowing playback to start before the file is completely downloaded

output_path

Purpose: Specifies the output file path
Usage: Final argument
Description: Determines where the processed video will be saved

Notes

There are conflicting -preset and -crf arguments in this command. The last occurrence of each will take effect, so the actual settings used will be -preset slow and -crf 23.
These settings aim to produce a high-quality output with a good balance between file size and visual quality.
The video is scaled to a maximum width of 1440 pixels, which is suitable for most high-definition displays.
The 10-bit color depth (yuv420p10le) can provide better color gradients and reduce banding, but may increase file size and may not be supported by all players.
The audio is encoded at a high-quality bitrate of 192k, which is suitable for most audio content.
The +faststart option is particularly useful for videos that will be streamed over the internet.

Customization

To increase quality at the cost of larger file size, you can lower the CRF value (e.g., -crf 20).
To reduce file size at the cost of quality, you can increase the CRF value (e.g., -crf 26).
The preset can be changed to 'faster' for quicker encoding or back to 'veryslow' for potentially better compression at the cost of much longer encoding times.
Adjust the maxrate and bufsize values proportionally if you need to target a specific bitrate.
If compatibility is a concern, you might want to change -pix_fmt yuv420p10le to -pix_fmt yuv420p for standard 8-bit color depth.

-y

Purpose: Overwrite output file without asking for confirmation
Usage: Global option

-i input_path

Purpose: Specifies the input file
Usage: Input file option

-preset slow

Purpose: Sets the encoding preset
Usage: Output file option
Description: Balances encoding speed and compression efficiency. 'slow' provides better compression than faster presets, at the cost of increased encoding time.

-crf 23

Purpose: Sets the Constant Rate Factor for quality-based variable bitrate
Usage: Output file option
Description: Range is 0-51, where 0 is lossless, 23 is default, and 51 is worst quality. Lower values mean better quality but larger file sizes.
